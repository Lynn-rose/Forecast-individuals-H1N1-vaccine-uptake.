## Overview
The H1N1 flu, sometimes called Swine flu is a type of influenza A virus. During the 2009-10 flu season, a new H1N1 virus began causing illness in humans and it was often called Swine flu and was a combination of influenza viruses that infect pigs, birds, and humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic in 2009. That year the virus caused an estimated 284,400 deaths worldwide. In August 2010, WHO declared the pandemic over. However, the H1N1 flu strain from the pandemic became one of the strains that cause seasonal flu. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But flu and its complications can be deadly, especially for people at high risk. The seasonal flu vaccine can now help protect against the H1N1 flu and other seasonal flu viruses.

The CDC recommends flu vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older in the United States since the 2010-2011 flu season. It is crucial for preventing flu and its complications, especially for those at higher risk. Suitability for vaccination or a specific vaccine depends on factors like age, health, and allergies. Various vaccines are approved for different age groups, and some are not recommended for specific individuals. Notably, there are three flu vaccines preferentially recommended for people aged 65 and older.

# Problem Statement
The goal of the "Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1" competition is to predict whether individuals received H1N1 vaccines based on their demographic information, opinions, and health behaviors. This predictive model has significant implications for public health initiatives and vaccine campaigns.

## Objective
To predict the probability for each individual receiving:

H1N1 Vaccine: The likelihood that a person received the H1N1 flu vaccine.
## Data Understanding
The dataset is derived from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey and contains information on 26,707 respondents, with each row representing one individual's responses. The dataset includes:

* Demographic Information: Age group, sex, race, education, income, and employment status.

* Health Behaviors: Measures like washing hands, avoiding large gatherings, and antiviral medication usage.

* Opinions and Knowledge: Levels of concern and knowledge about the H1N1 flu, opinions on vaccine effectiveness, and perceived risks.

* Health and Medical Data: Presence of chronic medical conditions, health insurance status, and healthcare worker status.

* Doctor Recommendations: Whether a doctor recommended the H1N1.
